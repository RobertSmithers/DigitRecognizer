There is an edgeDetection program in ./DigitRecognizer/JavaFiles/Edge.java
This program contains a method that detects edges in an image by comparing pixels to other pixels in the locality.

The neural network made from scratch is in ./MatricesAndSuch/Net.java
This program creates a neural network that tries (it really does try) to converge (by changing the weights between layers) to the global minimum of the error function.

Net.java relies on the Matrix.java and the Vector.java class
